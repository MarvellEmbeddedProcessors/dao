The DAO uses the SPDX-License -Identifiers license for the core libraries,
applications and drivers. The kernel components are naturally GPL-2.0 licensed.

Including big blocks of License headers in all files blows up the
source code with mostly redundant information.  An additional problem
is that even the same licenses are referred to by a number of
slightly varying text blocks (full, abbreviated, different
indentation, line wrapping and/or white space, with obsolete address
information, ...) which makes validation and automatic processing a nightmare.

Adding license information in this fashion, rather than adding full license
text, can be more efficient for developers; decreases errors; and improves
automated detection of licenses. The current set of valid, predefined SPDX
identifiers is set forth on the SPDX License List at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

DAO uses first line of the file to be SPDX tag. In case of *#!* scripts, SPDX
tag can be placed in 2nd line of the file.

For example, to label a file as subject to the Marvell-MIT license,
the following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: Marvell-MIT

To label a file as Marvell-Proprietary (for proprietary code e.g., virto), the
following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: Marvell-Proprietary

To label a file as GPL-2.0 (e.g., for code that runs in the kernel), the
following text would be used:

SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0

Any new file contributions in DAO shall adhere to the above scheme.
It is also being recommended to replace the existing license text in the code
with SPDX-License-Identifiers.

Any approvals shall be documented in "license/exceptions.txt" with record dates.

DAO project supported licenses are:

1. SPDX-License-Identifier: Marvell-MIT
2. SPDX-License-Identifier: Marvell-Proprietary
3. SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
